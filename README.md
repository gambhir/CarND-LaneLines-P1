Overview
---
The solutions provided in the drop implements a lane detection algorithm. 


The Project
---
P1.ipynb.ipynb implements the pipeline to detect lanes.The notebook should function as is without need for modification at this point. To see what's in the notebook and execute the code there, start the jupyter notebook server at the command line like this:

jupyter notebook P1.ipynb.ipynb
This command will bring up a browser window in the current directory  is and select it. Run the cells in the notebook from top to bottom to see the various data analysis steps.

The last two cell blocks takes video as an input and draws the lanes detected. The video player is embedded in a html page and would be visible when the page loads. 

There are two output vidoes written to test_videos_output folder.
